        In current world, it is quite time consuming and cumbersome to buy
        products via offline mode, also you just see the products that a
        shopkeeper has. On the contrary, in online mode, you can choose and
        compare products from variety of products/brands siting at the
        convenience of your home. So, it will be more convenient and time saving
        to buy the product online. Easy returns and cancellations come as the
        extra benefits. Online stores do not have space constraints and a wide
        variety of products can be displayed on websites. It helps the
        analytical buyers to purchase any product after a good search. Followed
        by countries like US, UK etc., this kind of working system has gained
        too much popularity in India as well. We reviewed over 20 websites to
        see how easy they make it for a user to find their product in an
        attractive way, how many offers they give to user to attract them in
        their web page of ecommerce application.
